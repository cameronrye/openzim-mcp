          ## Dependency Updates (Manual)

          This PR updates project dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

          **Note**: This was created by the legacy manual dependency update workflow.
          Regular automated updates are now handled by Dependabot (see `.github/dependabot.yml`).

          ### Changes
          - Updated `uv.lock` with latest dependency versions

          ### Testing
          - ✅ All tests pass with updated dependencies
          - ✅ Code quality checks pass

          ### Review Notes
          Please review the dependency changes and ensure compatibility.
