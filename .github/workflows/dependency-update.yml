            ## Dependency Updates (Manual)

            This PR updates project dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

            **Note**: This was created by the legacy manual dependency update workflow.
            Regular automated updates are now handled by Dependabot (see `.github/dependabot.yml`).

            ### Changes
            - Updated `uv.lock` with latest dependency versions

            ### Testing
            - ✅ All tests pass with updated dependencies
            - ✅ Code quality checks pass

            ### Review Notes
            Please review the dependency changes and ensure compatibility.
